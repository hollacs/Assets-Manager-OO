# Assets Manager OO
### Requirements
- AMXX 1.9.0+
- [OO Module](https://github.com/hollacs/oo_amxx/tree/no-std).
<br>
 This AMXX plugin helps you get rid of hard-coded asset file paths. <br>
 The sample plugin is located in `scripting/assets_example.sma` and it comes up with a json `configs/assets/example.json`<br>
 <br>
 Basically, the sample plugin loads the asset file paths from a json file, then creates a shockwave effect when the knife hits a wall and also play an explosion sound, changes the view model of the knife to the old CS 1.5 model, and plays a hostage sound when the knife attacks but doesn't hit anything.
